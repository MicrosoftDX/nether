## Introduction - What is Nether?

In working with gaming partners, from indie developers to AAA studios, we have realized they are often trying to solve common problems. There are hardly any new games that don't require a backend for player management, leader boards and analytics purposes. **Nether** is a project composed of reusable set of building blocks, projects, services and best practices designed to support these commong gaming workloads on [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com).
